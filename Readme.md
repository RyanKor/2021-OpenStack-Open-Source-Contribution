## 3. Error Logs (Setup : Cafe 24 Cloud)

#### 1. Ubuntu 20.04 Python3 `simplejson` Package Error
> Error Explanation : “Error: Cannot uninstall ‘simplejson’. 
> It is a distutils installed project and thus we cannot accurately determine which files belong to it which would lead to only a partial uninstall.

**Solution**
  - If you are trying to install the latest version of devStack in Ubuntu 20.04(the latest version of ubuntu), you will see a confilct of python package.
  - **you will not see this bug if you are using the stable version of devStack (Wallaby) in Ubuntu 18.04**
  > \> sudo dpkg -l | grep simplejson # find the package which has a string 'simplejson'
  
  > \> sudo apt remove python3-simplejson # remove this in the python packages.

#### 2. Ubuntu 20.04 Python3 `pyasn1-modules` Package Error
> Error Explanation : “Error: Cannot uninstall ‘pyasn1-modules’. 
> It is a distutils installed project and thus we cannot accurately determine which files belong to it which would lead to only a partial uninstall.

**Solution**
  - If you are trying to install the latest version of devStack in Ubuntu 20.04(the latest version of ubuntu), you will see a confilct of python package.
  - **you will not see this bug if you are using the stable version of devStack (Wallaby) in Ubuntu 18.04**

</p>

- My team has set up OpenStack with the whole same process of Wallaby, but we cannot use the network after we create a new instance in it.

**Solution**
  - We are still searching the solution why it occurs (we assume we can search iptables with trouble shooting)

---
#### 4. Exhausted all hosts available for retrying build failures for instance `OpenStack Resource Error`

> Error Explanation : Exceed the maximum resource of openstack when you make an instance.

**Solution**

- See the image below.

</p>

- when you see this error even though all the resources of openstack has enough space, the main reason of this error will be VCPU capacity in hypervisor menu.
- you should delete all volume & instances you don't use and re-create instance.


---
#### 5. Tox(OpenStack Documentation Tool, Sphinx Test Software) Error

> Error Explanation : `document isn't included in any toctree`
> There were several conflicts when I executed tox to commit the whole sphinx docs.

**Solution**

- See the image below.

</p>

- I have setup `:orphan:` the child node before commit.
- It enables the index.rst file to include the file with `:orphan:` code and recognize the whole documentation when CI works.


#### 6. Bug Report with python-openstackclient; openstack configuration show --mask

> Error Explanation : `openstack configuration show --mask` does not masking password & token in the console
> Devstack, Test Codes, and debug settings mask these things without any errors, but global & environmental configurations not
